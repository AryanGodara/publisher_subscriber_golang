Process Dynamic Requests, on http server
The net/http package contains all utilities needed to accept requests and handle them
dynamically. We can register a new handler with the http.HandleFunc function. Its first
parameter takes a path to match and a function to execute as a second.

Accept Connections
The last thing to finish off our basic http server is, to listen on a port to accept 
connections from the internet. As you can guess, Go also has an inbuilt HTTP server, we 
can start fairly quickly. Once started, you can view your HTTP server in your browser.

WEBSOCKETS:
